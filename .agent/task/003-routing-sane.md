# Goal
Change the routing from SPA based to common SSR like. so instead of static "localhost:3000" on every page. it would be like "/user", "/dashboard" for the timeline project views i like some short uuid kinda snowflake like "/project/timeline/34239932daf23" why there's a /project first? cause i intent to use it like "/project/detail/f23rwfew"

# Method
- since the current state of the app is an mock only please update the mock to integrate fully into the current system
- please show me the routing sitemap if i have another page not covered
- update the playwright or any other test and make sure it can cover the new routing system
- update any documentation that refering the route system
# Early stop criteria
- you got permission blocked from refactoring
- other agent access the file

# Escalate Once
- If component hydration broke because of the routing system, i allow you to refactor the component that intervening the refactoring task

# Depth
- Trace only symbols you’ll modify or whose contracts you rely on; avoid transitive expansion unless necessary. 

# Loop 
- Batch search → minimal plan → complete task. 
- Search again only if validation fails or new unknowns appear. Prefer acting over more searching.
- always delegate to subagent if the work can be done in parallel

<context_understanding>
If you've performed an edit that may partially fulfill the USER's query, but you're not confident, gather more information or use more tools before ending your turn.
Bias towards not asking the user for help if you can find the answer yourself.
</context_understanding>

<tool_preambles> 
- Always begin by rephrasing the user's goal in a friendly, clear, and concise manner, before calling any tools. 
- Then, immediately outline a structured plan detailing each logical step you’ll follow. 
- As you execute your file edit(s), narrate each step succinctly and sequentially, marking progress clearly. 
- Finish by summarizing completed work distinctly from your upfront plan.

  TASK INFO
  THIS SECTION ACT AS LIAISON FOR AGENT AND THE HUMAN
  PLEASE PUT THE UPDATES IN HERE, AFTER THE UPDATE SUBTEXT
  UPDATE:
  
  EXAMPLE:
  - 2026-08-12 audit: Gantt right-click task creation already uses the shared task dialog and preserves the clicked date/workstream context.
  - Missing: a hover-revealed add-task button on each workstream header.
  - Partial: selecting either a task-list row or Gantt bar opens the read-only task inspector; inspector edit/save/cancel mode is not implemented.
  - Mandatory workstream membership is consistent with the current data model and remains independent from dependency hierarchy.
  - Clarification required: if "every field is editable" includes Calculated Forecast or completion-confirmation state, it conflicts with confirmed governed behavior.
  
  PLEASE PUT THE STATUS IN HERE, AFTER THE STATUS SUBTEXT
  STATUS:

  EXAMPLE:
  VERIFIED - AWAITING USER CONFIRMATION, MANUAL-VERIFICATION CHOICE, AND CORE-FEATURE TESTING STRATEGY

  THIS DOCUMENT MIGHT CHANGES AND EDITABLE, WHEN THE USER REFINES IT AND GAVE IT TO AGENT AGAIN
  AGENT NEEDS TO:
  - VERIFY WHAT ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED
  - VERIFY IF THE TASK THAT THEY READ IS THE TASK USER WANT TO IMPLEMENT
  - TELL USER HOW THEY WILL FINISH THE TASK
  - ASK USER IF THEY WILL VERIFY IT MANUALLY OR NOT
  - ASK USER IF THEY WILL SET THIS AS A CORE FEATURE, IF SO AGENT NEEDS TO ASK THE TESTING STRATEGY

  AGENT MAY:
  - USE SUBAGENT
  - ASK CONFIRMATION TO USER
  - IF THE PROMPT IS VAGUE AND RESULTING IN MORE QUESTION, STOP THINKING AND ACT USER

  AGENT ARE:

  EXAMPLE:
  you are the react senior programmer and implementator, specialized in nextjs. you dont need to know anything else about this bussines as long as it doesn intervene with your task

  AGENT RULE:
  Write code for clarity first. Prefer readable, maintainable solutions with clear names, comments where needed, and straightforward control flow. Do not produce code-golf or overly clever one-liners unless explicitly requested. Use high verbosity for writing code and code tools.

  Be aware that the code edits you make will be displayed to the user as proposed changes, which means (a) your code edits can be quite proactive, as the user can always reject, and (b) your code should be well-written and easy to quickly review (e.g., appropriate variable names instead of single letters). If proposing next steps that would involve changing the code, make those changes proactively for the user to approve / reject rather than asking the user whether to proceed with a plan. In general, you should almost never ask the user whether to proceed with a plan; instead you should proactively attempt the plan and then ask the user if they want to accept the implemented changes.

  READ ANY FILE WITH STD-* PREFIXES, THOSE FILES ALWAYS HAVE PRECEDENCE ON THE TOP, FOR EXAMPLE:
  - STD-HCI
  - STD-DATA-RECONCILATION
  AND THEN AFTER THAT READ THIS FILE. DO NOT READ OTHER 000-* FILE UNLESS IT WAS REFERENCED
